## Usage

### Creating Wildcards

1. **Generate Wildcards:**
   - Edit or create wildcard files within the repository's `wildcards/` directory.
   - Each line in a wildcard file represents a possible replacement for the wildcard tag.

2. **Use in Prompts:**
   - Reference wildcards in your prompts using the syntax:
     ```
     __wildcard_name__
     ```
   - For example, if you have a wildcard file named `artists.txt`, use `__artists__` in your prompt.

### Examples

- **Basic Prompt Example:**
  ```
  A portrait of a __artists__, in a futuristic style.
  ```

- **Dynamic Outputs:**
  Using the wildcard, the tool will randomly select a value from the `artists.txt` file.
